# Sentience among the bees

So what Wikipedia really for my eyes to is the myth of a mindful queen that has been popular at least in my imagination and I suspect in many other people who have contemplated the lives of hymenultra.

Actually, any hive animal that we know over this world is probably autonomic rather than fine the instructions from essential intelligence.

So when I contemplate writing fiction or designing games based on hive life l, I'm at a quandary. You can't decide whether to go with the central intelligence idea. That is an over all power. All-powerful Queen or overseer who directs the activities of her soldiers and workers? Or should I develop the hive mind as a metaphor. Should I let my characters experience group think membership and their hive without without an actual essential intelligence. Even if there is a queen in the hive she does not give conscious directions. So how do you be workers and soldiers organized their lives.

I think this should be pretty interesting to write about because I think the aspect of the central queen I like the past is the sense of loyalty duty and disloyalty that the workers and soldiers experience. But it's not essential that the queen have complete conscious control of the hive. Any sense. The workers and soldiers can feel undying loyalty to their queen even if they're queen doesn't speak to them or sit in analytically. Think about their problems.

Come to think of it. Even serpents reach perhaps was not as completely dependent on the Central intelligence vision of the queen. Though it's true that the contrin and the protagonist thought Queens were the rulers of their hives. It might be more accurate just to say that the queen herself was merely a manifestation of the hive mind or the hive intelligence.

So in my works I think I will find a more satisfying to explore the hive mind as something that is embodied outside the queen. And yet still that the queen herself have a personality which is it's subordinate to the hive in many ways.
